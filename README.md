# DVHW4_stacked_chart

This is an assignment for Data Visualization (PPHA 30560) at Harris School of Public Policy. This code recreates the bar chart [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/18/404991483/how-machines-destroy-and-create-jobs-in-4-graphs), and my figure can be found [here](https://ashutayal.github.io/DVHW4_stacked_chart/).
